        <h3>What is Curried Chicken?</h3>
        <p>Curried chicken or chicken curry as known in India and some Caribbean islands is a <em>scrumptious</em> chicken dish made with turmeric, curry, pepper and various other spices. It can be eaten as a main dish with your choice of side such as white rice, bread, roti or rice and peas. In my home country of Jamaica, curried chicken is a loved dish and personally one of my favorite dishes to both make and eat!</p>
